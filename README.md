# Webscraping
Project made for the first cohort of code bozu, did web scraping, sentiment analysis, and data manipulation and visualization 

This project was worked on collaboratively by Ezra Cohen, Suma Dendi, Hawa Iman, and Diba Demir using Google collab in python for the most part, but for a couple of the data visualization parts we worked in RStudios

https://github.com/Ezra-A-Cohen/Politician_Data_Analysis is an ordered version of this repository (made by Suma Dendi), I won't be deleting this one in case anyone has an older version of my resume, the one difference between them is this one has the google colab files and the other has .py files, but the code is the same
