# Webscraping
Project made for the first cohort of code bozu, did web scraping, sentiment analysis, and data manipulation and visualization 

This project was worked on collaboratively by Ezra Cohen, Suma Dendi, Hawa Iman, and Diba Demir using Google collab in python for the most part, but for a couple of the data visualization parts we worked in RStudios

Since the files do not show in the correct order, the order is: Deliverable 0.docx, Copy_of_Bozu_Deliverable_1.ipynb, Deliverable_1.xlsx, map and party.R, map.pdf, birthday and party.R, birthday and party boxplot.png, wordclouds1.ipynb, wordclouds2.ipynb, deliverable 2.docx, deliverable4&5.ipynb (only until "df["pos"]=list2 df["neg"]=list3 csvfile = df.to_csv('df.csv',index=False)" since this is where deliverable 3 is created), deliverable 3.csv, deliverable4&5.ipynb (the rest of it) then finally Deliverables 4+5.docx
